# Bookshelf Project

This app allows users to keep track of their books.

## Functionality

The application consists of two pages: the **Main** page and the **Search** page.

### Main Page

The main page divides your library into three shelves, **Currently Reading**, **Read**, and **Want to Read**. Each book
displays a book cover, if available; the title; the author(s), if known; and a dropdown which allows you to move the
book to a different shelf or remove it altogether from your library.

### Search Page

The search page, accessed by clicking on the "plus" (`+`) button on the lower right hand side, allows you to search
through the book database for other books, which can then be added to a specific shelf in your library.

## Installation

To start the application:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
